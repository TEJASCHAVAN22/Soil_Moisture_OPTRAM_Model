# Soil_Moisture_OPTRAM_Model
The OPTRAM (OPtical TRApezoid Model) estimates soil moisture from optical remote sensing by using vegetation indices like NDVI and soil brightness indices such as the shortwave infrared ratio. It maps data into a trapezoidal feature space, where the upper and lower boundaries represent wet and dry soil conditions.
